Problem: 
- In read_response, everytime this function triggers it will overwrite the packet
- The fingerprint_event_t does not store the multifingerprint structure
- Uploaded event runs multiple times everytime a packet is received

Possible solution:
- Need something that store packets in the multifingerprint packet struct until the last packet is read
- Then store it to the fingerprint_event_t
- Need to change it to only trigger that event when the last packet arrives
